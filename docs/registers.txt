Four General Purpose Registers 
	- AX, BX, CX, DX
	- Each of which consists of 8 low bits and high bits
		- AH AL, BH BL, etc 
		- these registers can be used to hold one-byte quantities
		- N.B.: changing the value of AX will change AH/AL and vice versa 

Two Sixteen-Bit Index Registers 
	- SI, DI 
	- general purpose, by convention used as pointers 
	- (pnuemonic: SI(ndex) DI(ndex) (index as in pointer)) 
	- cannot be decomposed into High and Low one-byte registers 

Two Sixteen Bit Special Registers 
	- BP: Base Pointer 
	- SP: Stack Pointer 

Four Sixteen Bit Segment Registers 
	- CD: Code Seg
	- DS: Data Seg
	- SS: Stack Seg 
	- ES: Extra Seg

Sixteen-Bit Instruction Pointer(IP) Register
	- points to next instruction to execute 

TODO add flag register
